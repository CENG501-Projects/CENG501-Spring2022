# @TODO: Paper title

This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG501 (Spring 2022)](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr/~skalkan/DL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG501 (Spring 2022) Project List](https://github.com/CENG501-Projects/CENG501-Spring2022) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.

# 1. Introduction
Our project paper, Convolutional Neural Network Pruning with Structural Redundancy Reduction by Wang et. al., was accepted to CVPR 2021. In the paper, authors propose a network prunning method, which improves the performance of CNNs with removing filters from unnecessery layers. The main contribution of the paper is the method of filter selection for prunning, where the proposed algorithm differs from and outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. As the dataset, the authors used CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with the well-known networks such as ResNet or AlexNet. Although the paper is reproducible as a whole, we aim to compare different prunning approaches on CIFAR-10 only, while using ResNet as our network.
