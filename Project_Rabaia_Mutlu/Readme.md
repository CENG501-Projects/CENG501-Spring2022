# From Label Smoothing to Label Relaxation

This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG501 (Spring 2022)](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr/~skalkan/DL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG501 (Spring 2022) Project List](https://github.com/CENG501-Projects/CENG501-Spring2022) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.

# 1. Introduction

In this report, the implementation of the study "From Label Smoothing to Label Relaxation, AAAI 2021" is presented. In the study, a new loss function called "Label Relaxation" is proposed as an alternative to the conventional "Label Smoothing", where it is performed on several networks using different datasets. Our goal is to create our own algorithm and reproduce the presented results.   

## 1.1. Paper summary

In this paper, they proposed label relaxation (LR) as an alternative to the conventional label smoothing (LS). The proposed method, label relaxation is evaluated mainly by comparing it with the label smoothing. In addition, cross entrophy (CE), confidence penalizing (CP), and focal loss (FL) are also used to calculate accuracy and error in order to evaluate the proposed method. Various datasets and learning architectures were also used within the scope of the study.

# 2. The method and our interpretation

## 2.1. The original method

A parametric evaluation is conducted in order to evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method. Various datasets and learning architectures were used within the scope of the study. Different loss functions such as cross entrophy (CE), label smoothing (LS), confidence penalizing (CP), and focal loss (FL) are used for the evaluation.

## 2.2. Our interpretation 

@TODO: Explain the parts that were not clearly explained in the original paper and how you interpreted them.

# 3. Experiments and results

## 3.1. Experimental setup

MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets are used in this study. MNIST and FMNIST datasets are used for 2-layer dense architecture, and the rest are used for VGG16, ResNet56(v2) and DenseNet-BC(100-12).
We imported the datasets using “Keras” and we applied augmentation by flipping images. After augmentation, 1/7 of the whole data was labeled as the test set and 1/6 of the rest was labeled as the validation set using "train_test_split". The rest of the dataset is used for training and the batch size is taken as 64 as stated in the article. We used Pytorch's Cross Entropy loss and implemented the Label Smoothing and Label Relaxation losses. 

We obtained results for 2-layer architecture using MNIST and FMNIST datasets. Architectures for VGG16 and ResNet56(v2) were also prepared and presented, however, the results could not be presented due to lack of time and computational power.

## 3.2. Running the code

@TODO: Explain your code & directory structure and how other people can run it.

## 3.3. Results

@TODO: Present your results and compare them to the original paper. Please number your figures & tables as if this is a paper.
