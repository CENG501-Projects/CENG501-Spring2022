# 1. Introduction

In this report, the implementation of the study "From Label Smoothing to Label Relaxation, AAAI 2021" is presented. In the study, a new loss function called "Label Relaxation" is proposed as an alternative to the conventional "Label Smoothing" loss, where it is performed on several networks using different datasets. Our goal is to create our own algorithm and reproduce the presented results.   

## 1.1. Paper summary

This paper summerizes the derivation of the explicit form of the new proposed loss function. It is fundamantally based on comparing probabilistic predictions of targets with a group of possible distributions. In other words, the learner is set free to select the most appropriate probabilistic distribution of the targets among of a likelihood of probabilistics (based the Kullback-Leibler divergence) unlike label smoothing (LS) which restrects the trainer to one probability as shown below (left-side: Label smoothing, right-side: Label Relaxation).

Therfore, a closed form of the introduced loss function is proposed as:

To prove the accuracy of the mentioned loss, a comparison with other loss functions such as label smoothing, cross entrophy (CE), confidence penalizing (CP), and focal loss (FL) is made. Hence, various datasets and learning architectures were also employed within the scope of the study.


# 2. The method and our interpretation

## 2.1. The original method

The original method is mainly based on classification problem in which the trainer optimizes the best probabilistic distribution represented by a parameter (alpha), which is usually considered fixed in label smoothing. Therefore, it is included finetuned besides other hyperparameters such as learning rate, regularization, and weight decay, which are determined based on both cross-validation accuracy and error.    

## 2.2. Our interpretation 

@TODO: Explain the parts that were not clearly explained in the original paper and how you interpreted them.

# 3. Experiments and results

## 3.1. Experimental setup

MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets are used in this study. MNIST and FMNIST datasets are used for 2-layer dense architecture, and the rest is used for VGG16, ResNet56(v2) and DenseNet-BC(100-12).
We imported the datasets using “Keras” and 1/6 of the training set was labeled as the validation set using "train_test_split". Then, we performed preprocessing by subtracting the mean from the inputs. The batch size is taken as 64 as stated in the article. We used Pytorch's Cross Entropy loss and implemented the Label Smoothing and Label Relaxation losses. In training phase, a code piece is taken from PyTorch examples and modified for our case.
We obtained results for 2-layer architecture using MNIST and FMNIST datasets. Moreover, architecture for VGG16 is also prepared and presented, however, the results could not be presented due to lack of time and computational power.

## 3.2. Running the code

@TODO: Explain your code & directory structure and how other people can run it.

# 4. Conclusion

In this study, values close to the original results were obtained. Since the difference is in the acceptable range, it can be said that the method has been applied successfully. However, all analyzes could not be performed due to the lack of time and the long duration of the analyzes.
