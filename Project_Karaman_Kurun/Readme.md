# High-Fidelity and Arbitrary Face Editing

This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG501 (Spring 2022)](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr/~skalkan/DL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG501 (Spring 2022) Project List](https://github.com/CENG501-Projects/CENG501-Spring2022) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.

# 1. Introduction

High-Fidelity and Arbitrary Face Editing is a paper aimed at improving the outputs in face editing techniques. The paper was published at Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition journal in 2021. The goal is to 
@TODO: Introduce the paper (inc. where it is published) and describe your goal (reproducibility).

## 1.1. Paper summary

@TODO: Summarize the paper, the method & its contributions in relation with the existing literature.

# 2. The method and my interpretation

## 2.1. The original method

@TODO: Explain the original method.

## 2.2. My interpretation 

There are some misleading dimension sizes written in the actual implementation explanation in the paper. 
@TODO: Explain the parts that were not clearly explained in the original paper and how you interpreted them.

# 3. Experiments and results

## 3.1. Experimental setup

The dataset setup was slightly changed. The datasets used in the original paper are High quality but the ones we have used are the low quality versions of the same datasets due to the limited computing power we have with our local computers and the limitations in Google Colab.

@TODO: Describe the setup of the original paper and whether you changed any settings.

## 3.2. Running the code

The code was implemented using Google Colab, so uploading the Ipython file to the GoogleColab and executing code blocks following the structure can make it run. The network architectures and functions overall are implemented according to the paper.

@TODO: Explain your code & directory structure and how other people can run it.

## 3.3. Results

We didn't have the computational power in to produce any results. We have tried using Google Colab in order to produce any result but we couldn't manage without overstepping the daily quota. 
@TODO: Present your results and compare them to the original paper. Please number your figures & tables as if this is a paper.

# 4. Conclusion

@TODO: Discuss the paper in relation to the results in the paper and your results.
