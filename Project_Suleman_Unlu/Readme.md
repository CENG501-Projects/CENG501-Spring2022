# Joint Semantic-Geometric Learning for Polygonal Building Segmentation

This readme file is an outcome of the [CENG501 (Spring 2022)](https://ceng.metu.edu.tr/~skalkan/DL/) project for reproducing a paper without an implementation. See [CENG501 (Spring 2022) Project List](https://github.com/CENG501-Projects/CENG501-Spring2022) for a complete list of all paper reproduction projects.

# 1. Introduction

The paper is published at Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 2021. The paper aims that improving the performance on generating polygonal building segmentation. Besides that, previous related methods had some specific problems such as, relying on perfect segmentation map for vectorization quality, requiring complex post preprocessing procedure and generating inaccurate vertices with a fixed quantity or wrong sequential order. 

## 1.1. Paper summary

In this paper, to go one step further, three steps are proposed to build polygonal segmentation. They are Multitask Segmentation network, vertex generation module and polygon refinement network. Basically, in the multitask segmentation network, the pretrained model build pixel-wise segmentation on buildings, then locate the corners that are convex ad concave, for the last step, the model-oriented edges. Vertex generation module use the outputs from previous network and transform them into polygon vertices. In the last module, polygon refinement network, takes outputs from vertex generation module and the image itself from dataset, and then adjusts the corner coordinates to refine the polygonal segmentation.

# 2. The method and my interpretation

## 2.1. The original method
The original method consists of two parts which is a `Multi-task Segmentation Network` that predicts vertices of the polygon to segment the building, next there is a `Polygon Refinement Network` which takes these vertices and the cropped segment of the building and produces displacement values  for each vertex to improve the polygonal segmentation

### 2.1.1 `Multi-task Segmentation Network`

This module uses Res-U-Net architecture. Resnet101 for encoder and U-Net for decoder. For each pixel, cross entropy loss is used for the correct class value. And total loss can be summarized as:

L_total = X1 * L_seg + X2 * L_corner + X3 * L_orient where X is used to denote weights 

### 2.1.2 `Polygon Refinement Network`

The Polygon Refinement Network Consists of two major parts. The first major part is the **Resnet Backbone & Vertex Embedding** which acts as the feature extractor for each vertix. The second major part is the **Propogation Model & Coordinate Transforming & Refined Polygon Vertices** model which is actually just one Gated Graph Neural Network.

#### **Resnet Backbone & Vertex Embedding**
The resnet backbone is a variant of the ResNet50 where skip-connection structure are used to up-sample and concatenate the feature maps of four skip layers. The size of the final feature map for vertex embedding. The input to the Resnet Backbone is 224x224x3 cropped image of the building segment from the original picture through the bounding boxes corresponding to each building instance and rescaled into the same size. The skip concatination leads to a feature map of 112x112x256 for the same building segment. The coordinates of building vertices obtained from Vertex Generation Model  are transformed accordingly for vertex embedding on the final feature map of the backbone. Each vertex is assigned with the features extracted from the channel direction of the cube.

#### **Propogation Model & Coordinate Transforming & Refined Polygon Vertices**

The polygonal vertices obtained from the Vertex Embedding step are considered as nodes of a graph, and every two neighbouring vertices constitutes an edge of the graph. A gated graph neural network is used to learn the offset needed for each vertex , the displacement needed to move the vertex to the ground truth. After the propagation process through the Gated Graph Neural Network, two fully-connected layers are used to output a displacement value for each vertex.	The prediction of displacement value is also formulated as a classification issue and the model is trained with cross-entropy loss. In the coordinate transforming step, the output displacement classes of PRN are converted to the displacement coordinates, and added to the corresponding vertex coordinates.

## 2.2. My interpretation 

### 2.2.1 `Multi-task Segmentation Network`

In our implementation, we used ‘segmentation models’ library to build the Res-U-net architecture, and then by using the datasets we tried to feed the model.

### 2.2.2 `Polygon Refinement Network`

#### **Resnet Backbone & Vertex Embedding**
 
* The renet backbone structure was not explained in the paper, but rather could be found from one of the relevant literature mentioned which is from: [Efficient Interactive Annotation of Segmentation Datasets with Polygon-RNN++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09693.pdf)
* It is mentioned that the input to the resnet backbone is is a cropped image from the bounding box of the building segment. However, in the illustrations and the logic implies that it is not exactly cropped to the bounidng box , such as if the predicted vertex for the corner is underestimating the corner and within the building, the cropped input according to the bounding box would not include the building corner which would be the ideal point for the vertex to be moved. To solve this, a tolerance was introduced to the bounding box as a sort of padding to the bounding box, where the image croped for building segment is larger than the bounding box, which was not mentioned in the paper.
* For the training stage, the bounding box coordinates are provided from the dataset, however, in the inference stage of the model, the output of the Vertex Generation Model are the polygon vertices, not the bounding box, so there needs to be a stage of getting bounding box from segmentation vertices, this is interpreted as finding the maximum and minimum vertices of the segmentation in the x and y axis and adding the pre-defined tolerance to it.
* As the feature map generated from the encoder is of size 112x112 with a feature length of 256, the predicted vertices need to be scaled down to this scale.
* The arrow in the Main Figure 1 of the paper shows that the intermediate result generated from the Vertex Generation Model is used for the vertex embedding, however, as the input picture to the encoder is not the Intermediate result from the VGM but a cropped and rescaled image of one building instance from the intermediate results, the vertex coordinates used for the vertex generation model are interpreted as to be from the cropped and rescaled image and not from the intermediate result of full picture as using vertex coordinates scaled from the 300x300 picture to 112x112 would not represent the same coordinate but the vertex coordinates scaled down from the 224x224 cropped image would represent the same coordinate in the 112x112 version.

#### **Propogation Model & Coordinate Transforming & Refined Polygon Vertices**

* It is mentioned that every two neighbouring vertices constitutes an edge of the graph, however, it is not mentioned what the edge attributes are, are they directed edges or if they are weighted edges, or which information is integrated into these edges.
* Further, it is not specified what format the graphs are treated in, if they are as adjaceny matrices or if they are used as dictionaries or a different method.
* Tne implementation details of the Gated Graph Neural Network are also not given other than the information that the result from it is passed through two fully connected networks to generate the displacement prediction for each vertex. The vertices of the graph are also passed to the GGNN one at a time for each graph, it is not mentioned how the graph is interpreted to be passed thorugh this Graph Neural Network used as a Recurrent Neural Network.
* It is mentioned that the model predicts a displacement value and this is treated as a classification issue and trained with cross entropy loss. It is also mentioned that the model predicts a final output of format 15x15 incorporating a displacement og +7 and -7 from the centre of the 15x15 grid. However, it is not mentioned how this 15x15 output is mapped to a classification problem. This information is interpreted as converting each element of the 15x15 grid to a label from the range of 0 to 224 classes.
* It is also not mentioned if the output from the propogation model of [-7,7] pixels is to be appllied on the intermediate result coordinates or to the cropped building instance, or if it is to be added to the coordinate of the feature map of 112x112 dimentions. It is interpreted that the Coordinate Transforming step is added to the coordinates of the segment which is cropped, so these vertex points are displayed.

# 3. Experiments and results

## 3.1. Experimental setup

### 3.1.1 `Multi-task Segmentation Network`

For some architectural and technical reasons, we couldn’t build a fully connected polygon segmentation model. Working with a difficult and complex architecture and professional dataset lead us to having difficulties on building this paper’s method from zero. Therefore, the fully connected model could not be built.

### 3.1.2 `Polygon Refinement Network`

* As the dataset of the paper,OpenAI Mapping Challenge Dataset, was available on Kaggle, it was utilized through Kaggle directly to the Google Colab File.
* The Polygon Refinement Netwok is trained independtly of the Multi-task Segmentation Network, artificial training data was generated for the Polygon Refinement Network through the Dataset directly.
  * From the dataset, the first 500 instances of building segments are iterated over, which lead to 3985 vertex predictions.
  * As this is the ground truth data, artificial test data is created from this by adding random noise to the predicted vertex. 
  * It was also noted that the bounding box data of certain building segments were erroneous, where the ground truth segmentation and ground truth bounding box did not have any overlapping area. To solve this, bounding box information was generated from the segementation data , as would be done in inference phase, through the minimum and maximum of all the vertices of the polygon in x and y axis. From these min and max values, a tolerance is added to get the bounding box. 
  * This tolerance is added above to the bounding box to enlarge it, as further now in the cropepd building segment from the original picture, noise will be added to deviate the vertices from the true points. As the prediction of the vertex displacement is to be done in the range of [-7,7], this is also taken as the range of the noise added.
  * When the noise is added, the noisy polygon vertex located in the 112x112 feature map with 256 features is chosen as the data to analyse, and the noise added in the format of [A,B] , where A and B are values between +7 and -7, is trated as the truth label of this new data.
* As cross entropy is used as the loss, and the task is treated as a classfication problem, the label data is to be reformated from the [A,B], where A and B are values between +7 and -7, to multiclass labels and as this is a 15x15 grid, it converts to 255 individual labels from range 0 to 224.
  * This mapping function from [A,B] format to a label is performed through: $$Label=[(A+7)*15] + (B+7)$$.
  * Through this, the top left element,[-7,-7], of the 15x15 grid is formulated as 0, the bottom right element ,[7,7], is the last element with label 224, and the centre of the 15x15 grid which account for [0,0] displacement is labaled 112.
  * This mapping function also works to convert the label back to displacement which is the purpose of the Coordinate Transforming Model.
* The vertex and image originate in the format of a 300x300 image. After the bounding box is determined through the segmentation from the Multiclass Segmentation Network, The bouding box is cropped out and the vertex coordinates are transformed from the original 300x300 frame to this new arbitrary bounding box shape. Further this cropped image is now rescaled to 224x224 to be suitable as an input with resnet, and now the vertex coordinates are transformed with the ratio of: $$X_{new} = {X_{old}*224 \over X_{length} }$$ $$Y_{new} = {Y_{old}*224 \over Y_{length} }$$ These vertices are then halved to be applicable to the final feature map of 112x112
* These vertices , now transformed to the 112x112 shape, are then used to extract node-level 256 features for each vertex from the feature map.
* These nodes could then be used as inputs to the propogation model.


## 3.2. Running the code
As the two parts of Multi-Task Segmentation Network  and Polygon Refinement Network are trained seperately, they would also be explained seperately.
### 3.2.1 `Multi-task Segmentation Network`

As mentioned above, a complete segmentation network could not be achieved

### 3.2.2 `Polygon Refinement Network`
A Google colab file,*"CENG501_Polygonal_Refinement_Network.ipynb"*, is prepared which extensively explains the steps to run it, however they will be summarzied below:
* The dataset used is downloaded from Kaggle and the model does not require any other uploads/inputs from the user.
* The data is preprocessed and converted to a unified pandas dataframe to hold the filen details and also the annotations details.
![del1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69632507/177655663-ea14e713-22ae-4b94-b173-0b8913f1f7d7.jpg)
* Some of the data is visualized to show the user what nature of data they are dealing with. 
![del](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69632507/177655397-3b7e037b-a93f-4305-b0f6-47fb6266e104.jpg)
* It is then illustrated how the building instance images are transformed from 300x300 to Bounding Box Dimensions to 224x224 Images
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69632507/177657816-154b8fd2-d5c1-4a7d-8182-624d3caf8cca.png)
* The vertices in the 224x224 image are then exposed to noise to generate training data, with their orginal location being the ground truth location, and the displacement between these two acting as the label for the propogation model. The blue polygon is the ground truth and the red + symbols are the noisy segmentation generated to be finetuned by the Polygon Refinement Network
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69632507/177658122-b2cbe42a-cbfc-4565-9ad5-dabb7bb5fb63.png)
* These red vertices are then passed through vertex embedding to be associated with their 256 features for their location. This data is now ready for the Propogation Model
* As enough implementation details  were not provided to formulate the vertices of the polygon effectively into a graph and could not be found on external literature referenced in the paper as well on how to pass the the nodes of the graph individually into the GRU based RNN model that takes graph nodes sequentially, other propogation methods were attempted to get results.
* Two Ideas were tested with the same target of predicting the displacement of the Vertice given the Vertice with 256 node features.
* The first model tested was based on the idea proposed in the paper where a fully connected network was made that would take these 256 features and predict a class of the displacement among the labels of 0 to 224, this model was trained with cross entropy loss.
  * Something that was realized during this training was that treating this problem as a clasification problem may not be the best idea as there are no details given on how the 15x15 grid was converted to class labels, the method chosen for duplication was arbitrary to map each element of the grid into a class label. But a problem that arises here is that if the actual displacement was [7,7] for example, the loss function should be in such a way that a guess of [7,6] should be penalized much less than a guess of [0,0]. This is an issue with the choice of loss function, and the problem nature suggests to treat it as a regression problem instead where if Mean Squared Error is used as the loss function, the guess of [7,6] would be penalzied much less than the guess of [0,0]. 
* The second model was now made in such a way that the criterion was changed to Mean Squared Error from Categorical Cross Entropy and the labels were kept in the format of [A,B] instead of class labels. The output layer of the fully connected network now has 2 neurons to predict the X and Y displacement. 


## 3.3. Results

### 3.3.1 `Multi-task Segmentation Network`

To work on professional architectures and datasets, we need to learn and experience more in this field. Since the model doesnt accept the dataset in different structures, we couldn not produce a segmentation map. On the other hand, the paper has very little detail about the inner layers of research, so it is hard for us to learn this field and implement the state of art from zero.

### 3.3.2 `Polygon Refinement Network`
* As a building segment is passed through the encoder to get a 112x112x256 feature map, some of the feature layers of this feature map are illustarted below:
* The input image to the encoder is: 
  * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69632507/177661083-d5a55044-fc6c-4686-8620-4d448f33c1bb.png)
* Six randomly selected feature layers of the feature map
  * ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69632507/177661218-eebf0c70-0509-4487-b5b4-33ebf4905468.png)
* Regarding the result of the First Propogation Model which was trained as a classfication model with Categorical Class Entropy with 225 different classes, the model quickly went to overfitting and memorizing the training data and no learning was happening on the testing data. As there are 225 classes to predict from, a random classifier would attain an accuracy of 0.44% accuracy and in this model's case, the training accuracy reached 88%, however, the testing accruacy is still fluctuating around the accuracy of a random classifier, suggesting no learning is happening and the model was interrupted early on.

* Regarding the result of the Second Propogation Model which was trained as a regression model with Mean Squared Error, it was expected to perform better than the first model as there was more room to learn with the possibility of predicting displacements closer and closer to the ground truth. However, despite several iterations and efforts, the model was not learning as shown in the image illustarted below.

# 4. Conclusion
#### Discussion on Result
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69632507/177663863-ec7e2f51-1a77-4075-92dc-d42f0ede55e8.png)
Out of the desired model to duplicate above :
* Building Instance : 
  * It was interpreted by self defined bounding box through polygon vertices and further adding a margin to the bounding box to keep the building instance centred and give room to add noise to the vectors as they are no longer on the edge of the cropped image as they would be if tolerance was not added.
* ResNet Backbone :
  * The Resnet backbone was duplciated successfully to generate a 112x112x256 feature map given a scaled input of 224x224x3
* Vertex Embedding :
  * The vertex embedding was done by transforming the vertices from original image to bounding box image, to the image rescaled for resnet input ,to the feature map generated from encoder, and the vertex coordinate was embedded with the channel values in the feature map.
* Propogation Model :
  *  The Gated Graph Neural Network could not be implemeted due to limited resources on the topic and few implementation details on the matter. It was attempted to be replaced with two other models which did not work. The suspected reason behind model 1 , treated as classification model, failing was with the large amount of classes available and limited training data provided in the scale of classes exisiting. Another reason for it to fail was that ,as it is treated as a categorical cross entropy, two incorrect classes are treated equally incorrect, however, a misclassification of [6,7] for truth value of [7,7] should be penalized less than a misclassification of [0,0] for truth of [7,7]. 
  *  The second model,treating as a regression problem, also faile to learn. Multiple hyperparameters and model variations were tested, it was concluded that a single channel of the feature map is not satisfactory to predict the displacement value. However, it is possible to preidct the displacement of the vertex just from a single polygon node withou the need of a graph, this would be possible with not just inputting a single channel as the node of the polygon but rather a larger receptive field of the final feature map to the propogation model, such as a kernel size of 3x3 or 5x5 with the polygon node in the centre.
  *   A more effective way of achieving this would be , as a future work, to train the encoder and the propogation model together for a single node of the polygon where the input to the propogation model is not just a 1x356 feature but a 3x3x256 feature matrix . A further improvement to this would be to decrease the depth of the feature size from 256, just to increase the size of the receptive field of the polygon node without loss in computational efficiency.
*  Coordinate Transforming :
  *  This was done for the first proppogation model, where the model preidcted a class for the dispalcement and it needed to be converted to the displacement value through the mapping function discussed before.

#### Discussion on Paper's Polygon Refinement Network
* The main concept behind the paper's Polygon Refinement Network is to have a polygonal segmentation, convert it into a graph with with each vertex having features from the encoder, and connect adjacent sequential edges with an edge. Since details are not provided on the properties or features in the edge, or if it is weighted, and from the referenced paper, they have used just two way directed graph between polygon nodes, it could be assumed that the same is done here.With this graph ready, each node of the graph is passed one by one into the recurrent GNN or the Gated Graph Neural Network, propogation happens and after a fully connected layer, a prediction is made on one of the graph nodes, then the next graph node is inputted to this RNN and the next prediction is based on the previous prediction. 
* A potential disadvantage with such a design could be the fact that when polygons are used for segmentation, their most valued property could be their relative position with respect to each other. An example of this could be the fact that a recntangle and a parallelogram when converted into a graph with the idea proposed in the paper where edges are not given important features, or not mentioned about much, however the nodes are given very dense features. This method would lose a lot of the vital information that could be kept in the edges, such as the distances, angle deviations from a principal axis and so on. A second disadvantage could be that as an RNN structure is used along with giving the polygon nodes one by one, the polygon is converted and treated as a sequence of nodes, which would not be a very accurate representation as in polygons, as for polygons, the sequence of nodes are less important and the positions of these nodes with respect to each other is more important.
* The motivation behind using this RNN ,although not explicitly stated in the paper, could be inferred that for the purpose of building segmentations ,as is the case of the paper, there are sequences in the nodes of the polygon shapes, patterns that could be learned such as recntagles and squares and more geometric shapes as most buildings would classify into these regular shapes. However , if this method would be scaled to a diverse set of use cases for polygonal segmentations of potentially irregular objects, it could be hypothesised that such a model would not perform very well, rather a Graph Neural Network with more informational edges in the graph could perform better than a Gated Graph Neural Network through a RNN
